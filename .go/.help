This is a demonstration application which makes use of dot-slash-go
to present its interface.

You can place any scripts here and dot-slash-go will automatically make
them available, you can also add <command>.help files to provide contextual
help information for individual commands.

Directories allow you to create tree based command hierarchies and you
can add a .help file to each directory to describe what that tree does.
